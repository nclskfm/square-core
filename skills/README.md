# Skills
Skills define how the user query should be processed by the Datastores and Models services and how the answers are obtained. For question answering, this might involve retrieving background knowledge from the Datastores and/or extracting spans from context using a particular Model and Adapter.

Skills can be added dynamically to UKP-SQuARE. Check out the ðŸ‘‰ [Add New Skills](#Add-New-Skills) for details.

For a list of available skills, see ðŸ‘‰ [Publicly Available Skills](#publicly-available-skills).

## Add New Skills
### The Predict Function
To create a new skill, only a predict function needs to be implemented. For facilitating this, we provide three packages: [square-datastore-client](https://github.com/UKP-SQuARE/square-datastore-client), [square-model-client](https://github.com/UKP-SQuARE/square-model-client) and [SQuARE-skill-api](https://github.com/UKP-SQuARE/square-skill-api). The client packages facilitate the interaction with other SQuARE services, such as Datastores and Models. The skill-api package wraps the final predict function creating an API that can be accessed by SQuARE. Further, it provides dataclasses (pydantic) for input and output of the predict function.

As mentioned above mainly a predict function, defining the pipeline needs to be implemented. 
First, install the required packages:
```bash
pip install square-datastore-client
pip install square-model-client
pip install square-skill-api
```
Next, we can implement the `predict` function:
```python3

# import utility classes from `square_skill_api` and `square_skill_helpers`
from square_skill_api.models import QueryOutput, QueryRequest
from square_model_client import SQuAREModelClient
from square_datastore_client import SQuAREDatastoreClient

# create instances of the SQuAREDatastoreClient and SQuAREModelClient for interacting 
# with SQuAREs Datastores and Models
square_datastore_client = SQuAREDatastoreClient()
square_model_client = SQuAREModelClient()

# this is the standard input that will be given to every predict function. 
# See the details in the `square_skill_api` package for all available inputs.
async def predict(request: QueryRequest) -> QueryOutput:

    # Call the Datastores using the `data_api` object
    data_response = await square_datastore_client(datastore_name="nq", index_name="dpr", query=request.query)
    context = [d["document"]["text"] for d in data_response]
    context_score = [d["score"] for d in data_response]

    # prepare the request to the Model API. For details, see Model API docs 
    model_request = {
        "input": [[request.query, c] for c in context],
        "task_kwargs": {"topk": 1},
        "adapter_name": "qa/squad2@ukp"
    }

    # Call Model using the `model_api` object
    model_response = await square_model_client(
        model_name="bert-base-uncased", 
        pipeline="question-answering", 
        model_request=model_request
    )

    # return an QueryOutput object created using the 
    # question-answering constructor
    return QueryOutput.from_question_answering(
        model_api_output=model_response,
        context=context,
        context_score=context_score
    )

```
### Adding Via Pull Request
If you want to run your Skill directly on SQuARE hardware, you can submit a [pull request](https://github.com/UKP-SQuARE/square-core/pulls) with the following changes:
1. Put your skill function in a file under: `./skills/<skill-name>/skill.py`
2. Add you skill in the [config.yaml](https://github.com/UKP-SQuARE/square-core/blob/master/config.yaml). Give the skill the same name as the folder under skills. Add your username as author.
3. Once you pull request is approved, your skill url will be `http://<skill-name>`

### Adding Self-Hosted or Cloud Skills
#### Azure Functions
1. Login to [Azure](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Create a new function app
    - Select to publish _Code_
    - Select _Python_ as runtime stack.
3. Once the deployment is complete, under Next Steps, click _create function_ and follow the setup instructions according to your development environment.
4. During the setup:
    - Use the _HTTP Trigger_ template
    - Name the function _query_ (*This is very important, since this will determine the url under which your function will be available.*)
    - Select _anonymous_ as authorization level.
5. Develop your skill in the __init__.py
6. Add environment variables to the `local.settings.json` file under `Values`.
6. Deploy your skill according to the instructions
7. Copy the URL of your deployment and use it when creating a skill in SQuARE without the trailing `/query` (e.g. https://myskill.azurewebsites.net/api). 
An example repository can also be found at [UKP-SQuARE/cloud-example-azure](https://github.com/UKP-SQuARE/cloud-example-azure)

## Local Setup
Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies and development dependencies:
```bash
make install
make install-dev
```

To setup the authentication locally, create a private key and token. The command below will create a file called `private_key.pem` in the root of the project. Furthermore, it will print a token.
```bash
make auth
```

You can run the _local_ skill now with
```bash
make run
```
Or if you like to run a specific skill run:
```bash
make run skill=<skill-name>
```
Note: This copies the selected skill.py into a folder called `skill`. This is a little hack to keep prod and dev aligned. As soon as you interrupt uvicorn (e.g. via Keyboard Interrupt), this folder will be deleted.

Go to [localhost:8000/docs]([localhost:8000/docs]) to interact with the Skill API. Note that, this is just for development and other services like the models or datastores require a seperate setup.
